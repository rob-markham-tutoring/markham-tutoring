## A Quick Introduction

Hi, I'm Rob! It's great to meet you---thanks for visiting my website! If you're looking for high-quality tutoring or want to learn new skills related to math, science, or programming, I'm confident that you're in the right place.

First, a quick introduction: I grew up and attended high school in Markham. I didn't start out as the best student, but I spent several years working hard to develop strong study habits. Eventually, I began to experience more academic success; by the time I graduated, I was selected as class valedictorian and completed my final two years of high school with all of my grades in the high 90's.

After graduating from high school in Markham, I went on to attend the [Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/mechanical-engineering). At Waterloo, I was frequently in the Top 5-10% of my academic class and earned marks above 90% in a majority of my courses (which included topics such as advanced calculus, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, materials science, control systems engineering, etc.).

While at Waterloo, I was also involved in research with professors in fields such as biomechanics, rehabilitative engineering, and fluid mechanics. In addition, I had the opportunity to work for several companies as part of [Waterloo's co-op education program](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/co-op), including work terms in both San Francisco, California (as a data scientist for a technology start-up) and Germany (as a researcher at a medical research institute).

I understand the challenges associated with learning new topics in math and science. It takes *a lot* of hard work to make difficult concepts 'click'. But there is truly no better feeling than finally mastering a challenging concept. This is what I love most about teaching: there is nothing more rewarding than helping my students develop their confidence in a previously difficult subject area!

I utilize a friendly and compassionate approach in my teaching, and I aim to make the learning process an enjoyable one. In addition to teaching the fundamental knowledge needed to succeed in specific subjects, I also encourage the development of effective study habits that will benefit my students as they continue on to higher levels of education.

## Frequently Asked Questions

***Q: What are your hourly rates for tutoring sessions?***

> At the current moment, I am offering **one-hour tutoring sessions at a rate of $50/hour**. I offer reduced rates for multiple-hour sessions (i.e., two- or three-hour sessions).

***Q: Do you offer reduced or discounted rates?***

> I always try to reserve a limited number of tutoring spots for those students/families who demonstrate financial need. If you are *unable* to afford my posted rates due to financial circumstances, please mention this in the open-response section when completing my intake forms. I believe that motivated, persistent, and hardworking students should **not** have their opportunities for success limited as a result of financial hardship.

> No---all sessions are charged at the same rate. However, I am more than happy to schedule a brief call or in-person meeting with you to answer your questions before you decide to commit to any of my services.

***Q: What are your regular tutoring hours?***

> I have a flexible schedule and will work with you to find convenient dates/times for tutoring sessions. I am available on all days of the week (except Mondays) and can accommodate sessions both *before and after school hours.*

***Q: Where do you conduct your tutoring sessions?***

> I can accommodate sessions both at-home and in public spaces (such as libraries). I will ask you about this when I first contact you upon having completed the appropriate intake form.
